### Hi there 👋🏾

I'm a software engineer with a masters degree and interdisciplinary work history in the field of tech and education. I'm experienced in developing full-stack scalable applications in JavaScript, React and Node.js. I've also performed data exploration in Python with libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Natural Language Toolkit. I'm passionate about writing clean modular code and communicating in languages spoken by humans (fluent in English and Spanish) and computers (JavaScript and Python) ❤️

Below are some of my favorite repos to highligh some of the solo and team web and mobile applications that I've built. I also enjoy contributing to open source projects with **Code.org** and **Intuit**. Feel free to explore!
